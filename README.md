# Digital Logic Circuits Design Lab (DLD Lab) Reports

This repository contains the lab reports and associated materials for the Digital Logic Circuits Design (DLD) lab. In this lab, we coded with Verilog in ModelSim, worked with Quartus II, and implemented our designs on the FPGA.

This lab was conducted under the supervision of [Prof. Zain Navabi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vud0kaEAAAAJ&hl=en).

## Experiments

### [Experiment 1 - Clock and Periodic Signal Generation](./Experiment%201%20-%20Clock%20and%20Periodic%20Signal%20Generation.pdf)
- **Description:** This experiment introduced participants to digital logic gates' static characteristics, delay times, clock frequency generation, and digital system design using schematic diagrams. It covered tools like power supply, function generator, and oscilloscope, along with concepts such as 74 Series Basic Logic Gates, oscillator circuits (including the LM555 timer IC and Schmitt trigger oscillator), and sequential circuits with clocks and counters. Through hands-on exploration and theory, participants gained insights into digital electronics and system design principles.

### [Experiment 2 - Sequential Synthesis and FPGA Programming](./Experiment%202%20-%20Sequential%20Synthesis%20and%20FPGA%20Programming.pdf)
- **Description:** The first goal of this experiment was to introduce the concepts of state machines that are mostly used for controllers. The second goal was to get familiar with FPGA devices and implementation.

### [Experiment 3 – Function Generator](./Experiment%203%20–%20Function%20Generator.pdf)
- **Description:** This experiment focuses on designing an Arbitrary Function Generator (AFG) and understanding its essential components, such as the waveform generator, function selectors, frequency selector, amplitude selector, and ROM memory. The experiment also covers the integration of ROM memories into the AFG design and provide an opportunity to develop proficiency in schematic design using Quartus II.

### [Experiment 4 – Accelerator and Wrappers](./Experiment%204%20–%20Accelerator%20and%20Wrappers.pdf)
- **Description:** System on Chip is an integrated circuit that integrates multiple components including digital, analog, hardware, and software programs all in a single chip. The main core of an SoC is a processor that handles different computational tasks within the system. In addition to the processor, the system includes memory, Input/Output ports, and accelerators. Accelerators are dedicated computation units that usually execute one specific task. This single task needs a smaller and less complicated datapath which leads to a high frequency of operation for the accelerators. This is contrary to CPUs in which millions of operations must be executed within a fixed time interval. This imposes a low frequency of operation for CPUs.
